# Eve: The Ultimate Personal Assistant (n8n + GPT + Python)

Welcome to **Eve**, your emotion-aware, visually-intelligent, memory-capable personal assistant powered by **n8n**, **OpenAI GPT-4o**, and **Python**. Eve can:

* Analyze your **facial expression** and mood
* Understand your **environment** using your webcam
* Store and recall **contextual memories**
* Interact across **email, calendar, contacts, and content tools**

---

## Features

* Visual recognition via webcam using OpenCV
* Emotion detection with GPT-4o based on facial expressions
* Scene, object, and appearance analysis
* Custom prompt routing and memory logging
* Modular workflows you can import into n8n

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eve-assistant.git
cd eve-assistant
```

### 2. Install n8n Locally

Install globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g n8n
```

Run n8n:

```bash
n8n
```

Access the UI at `http://localhost:5678`

> You can also use [n8n desktop](https://n8n.io/download) if you prefer a GUI installer.

### 3. Import Workflows

In the n8n UI:

* Go to **Workflows > Import**
* Import the following JSON files from this repo:

  * `image_agent.json`
  * `EVE.json`
  * `.json`
  * 

### 4. Python Webcam Script Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

Run the webcam capture script manually or via n8n:

```bash
python3 capture_and_encode.py
```

This will capture a frame, optimize it, and output a base64 string for imageAgent.

> The script includes auto-exposure stabilization and JPEG compression for faster GPT-4o upload.

### 5. Spotify Integration (Optional)

To auto-play music:

* Open your Spotify playlist link
* Or use the Spotify Web API (requires OAuth setup)

Simple example (Windows):

```bash
start "" "https://open.spotify.com/playlist/YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID"
```

## üîÑ How It Works

1. **Webcam Triggered:** A Python script captures your webcam image
2. **ImageAgent:** Sends image to GPT-4o for analysis
3. **Emotion Check:** If you're sad/stressed, Eve offers a break or lo-fi
4. **Spotify:** Opens your playlist via command or API
5. **Memory:** Logs emotion + response time for future use
